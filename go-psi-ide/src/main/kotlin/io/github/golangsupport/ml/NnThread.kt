/**
 * The one thread of the network (the model is not reentrant; everything that touches it runs here). It runs at a low priority: the
 * loading and warm-up, the prefill of an opened file and the closing of sessions are background work that must not compete with the
 * EDT and the highlighting for the cores. While a completion request is queued or running — the grey text the user is waiting for —
 * the priority is raised to the normal one and lowered back once no completion waits. No extra threads: the caller of [complete]
 * raises it when it queues, the completion itself confirms it when it starts, the last caller lowers it.
